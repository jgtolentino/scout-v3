# 🤖 AI Agent Profiler System - COMPLETE

## Overview
Complete automated deployment verification system that runs after every Scout Analytics deployment to ensure production quality and automatically creates GitHub issues when problems are detected.

## 🎯 System Components

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`deploy_verify.yml`)
- **Triggers**: Every push to `main` or `feature/**` branches
- **Process**: Build → Deploy → Audit → Report Issues
- **Artifacts**: Screenshots and audit logs automatically uploaded
- **Auto-Issue**: Creates GitHub issue with full error details when failures detected

### 2. AI Agent Script (`ci/audit_deploy.js`)
- **Engine**: Playwright headless browser automation
- **Tests**: Console errors, network failures, dashboard-specific health checks
- **Capture**: Full-page screenshots, performance metrics, error logs
- **Intelligence**: Scout Analytics-specific validation (KPIs, data loading, UI elements)

### 3. Package Scripts
- `npm run audit` - Test local development build
- `npm run audit:prod` - Test production deployment
- Integrated with existing build/preview workflow

## 🔍 What Gets Tested

### JavaScript & Network Health
- ✅ Console errors and exceptions
- ✅ Network request failures (4xx, 5xx, timeouts)
- ✅ Resource loading issues
- ✅ Performance metrics (load time, paint events)

### Scout Analytics Specific
- ✅ Dashboard components rendering (KPI cards, charts, navigation)
- ✅ Data loading state validation
- ✅ Real data presence (non-zero values)
- ✅ Scout/TBWA branding elements
- ✅ Error message detection

### Visual Documentation
- ✅ Full-page screenshot capture
- ✅ Viewport consistency (1366x768)
- ✅ Animation-disabled for consistent captures

## 📊 Current Test Results

Push → Build → Deploy → Audit → ✅ GREEN CHECK
```

### Problem Detected
```
Push → Build → Deploy → Audit → ❌ ERRORS FOUND
                              ↓
                     📝 Auto-create GitHub Issue:
                        - Error details with JSON logs
                        - Screenshot artifact link
                        - Fix instructions
                        - Auto-assign to repo owner
                     ↓
                     🔴 CI FAILS (blocks merge)
```

## 📝 Auto-Generated Issue Format

When the AI agent detects problems, it creates/updates GitHub issues like this:

```markdown
### 🛑 Scout Analytics deployment audit failed – 2025-06-14 11:36 UTC

**URL tested:** https://scout-xyz.vercel.app
**Commit:** abc123def
**Branch:** feature/new-dashboard
**Workflow:** [#123](github.com/repo/actions/runs/123)

```json
{
  "errors": [...],
  "dashboardTests": {...},
  "performanceMetrics": {...}
}
```
</details>

**📸 Screenshot** – available in Actions artifacts panel

### 🔧 Next Steps
1. Check the screenshot to see visual state of dashboard
2. Review console errors above  
3. Fix issues in `src/` files or database queries
4. Test locally with `npm run audit`
5. Push fix and verify CI passes
```

## 🔧 Key Features

### Intelligent Error Classification
- **Console Errors**: JavaScript exceptions, failed resources
- **Network Failures**: API calls, missing assets, timeouts  
- **Dashboard Issues**: Missing KPIs, stuck loading, no data
- **Performance Issues**: Slow load times, poor metrics

### Production-Ready Configuration
- **Security**: Read-only mode, no credential exposure
- **Performance**: ~15s execution time in CI
- **Reliability**: Timeout handling, error recovery
- **Scalability**: Minimal resource usage, efficient screenshots

### Developer Experience
- **Local Testing**: Same audit script works locally
- **Clear Reporting**: Structured JSON logs + visual screenshot
- **Auto-Triage**: Issues auto-assigned and labeled
- **Integration**: Seamless with existing CI/CD pipeline

- **Faster Debugging**: Structured error logs with context

### For Product/QA
- **Quality Gates**: Red CI blocks broken deployments 
- **Issue Tracking**: Problems automatically logged to GitHub
- **Historical Record**: Audit artifacts for every deployment
- **Stakeholder Confidence**: Automated validation of live site

### For DevOps
- **Zero Config**: Works out of the box with Vercel
- **No Secrets**: Uses built-in GitHub token only
- **Lightweight**: Single Node.js script, minimal dependencies
